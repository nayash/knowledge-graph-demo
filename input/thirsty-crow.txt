One hot day, a thirsty crow flew in search of water. After a long time, he saw a pitcher in a garden. The crow looked inside and saw that there was very little water at the bottom.
He tried to reach the water with his beak, but it was too low. Then the clever crow thought of a plan. He picked up small stones one by one and dropped them into the pitcher.
Slowly, the water rose higher and higher. The crow drank the water happily and flew away.
